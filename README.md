# Spam_Message_or_Email_Detector

This project involves building a classifier to detect spam messages and emails with high precision. The model applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques for effective text preprocessing, making it useful for individuals and businesses to filter out unwanted communications.

## Overview
- Developed a spam classifier to identify spam messages and emails using various features derived from text data.
- Utilized Python with libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-Learn** for data preprocessing and model training.
- Applied NLP techniques for text preprocessing, including **tokenization** and **TF-IDF vectorization**.
- Implemented classification algorithm like **Na√Øve Bayes** to achieve high accuracy in spam detection.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.
